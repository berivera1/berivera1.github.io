<li class="about_li list-group-item" id="BladeSymphony"><a href="#" class="popup" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus" data-placement="left" title="Blade Symphony" data-content="Blade Symphony's take on the fighting genre focuses on skillful swordfights, placing a heavy emphasis on intense one-on-one duels. Multi-round battles play out in a third-person perspective that brings recent melee-centric brawlers like Chivalry and War of the Roses to mind, though the swordplay is far more fluid and elegant in this game's pressure-cooker matches. When most fighting games of this sort sport dozens of characters, having only four to pick from is painfully limiting. Blade Symphony instead goes in another direction, by offering a large range of swords and outfit customization options to unlock. While the outfit accoutrements are only cosmetic, the swords do add perks and penalties that play into combat.">Blade Symphony</a></li>

Jack has also blotted out much of the light on the planet by having a giant orbiting H-shaped base set in front of Pandora's stationary moon, creating a 'big brother' atmosphere throughout the planet. The new group of Vault Hunters in Borderlands 2 are tasked with killing Jack and returning peace to Pandora.">Borderlands 2</a></li>
