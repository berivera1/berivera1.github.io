<h3 style="text-align:center">Survive</h3>
<p>A mobile-style game in which you must move left and right going on and off of platforms to avoid running into spikes on the top and bottom of the 
screen, as well as platforms made of spikes. Complete with a soundtrack stolen from many different artists and even a Two-Player mode! Want your friends to hate you (or vice versa)? 
Play a couple of rounds of Two-Player mode, and your friends will become raging with jealousy.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
<p>A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made for school using BlueJ. The instructions are pretty self-explanatory (I mean, its Tic-Tac-Toe), but if you have 
difficulty wrapping your head around this apparently mind-bogglingly complex game, I will explain it to you. One player plays as a person named "Mr X". Another player plays as 
someone named "Mr O". There is a 3x3 panel in which Mr X places Xs and Mr O places Os. When there are "three in a row", the winner is crowned victor and the looser is prepared 
to be sacrificed to the lord of hell, Satan. Fun fact, hell is also the realm which invented this terribly devilish game in the first place, as a reminder for the people of the 
world to satisfy the devil by completing the annual sacrifice and insuring that he doesn't come up and just brutally murder everybody (he's kinda a buzz kill like that).</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">A Bit of Luck: Last of the Species Edition</h3>
<p style="padding-right:20px;margin-bottom:0">Based off of the Scratch game <i>A Bit of Luck</i>, this version includes more levels, more detailed backgrounds,
more detailed  textures, two entire new in-game worlds, an entire final boss fight, and a new soundtrack (over 5 times the size of the original)! After the nuclear apocalypse annihilated the entirety of the human
race, as  well as all species on earth, a fish, mutated to be able to live on land, awakes in the middle of a solitude forest, and must learn to survive in the apocalyptic wasteland void of life, but not danger. 
Wandering around a forest, a factory, and a cave, you explore vast wastelands to answer the question, is there any life still out there, or are you all alone in the end?</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Race Car Game!</h3>
<p style="padding-right:20px;margin-bottom:0">The game that started it all. This is the first game I ever "coded" (cause it was made in Scratch). Complete with 
the terrible crappy art of a 7th grader, odd controls, two-player mode, and even a series of nearly impossible levels which would more than likely cause you to throw your computer 
out of the window! Now with 70% more orange!</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Lunar Lander</h3>
<p style="padding-right:20px;margin-bottom:0">As with Race Car Game!, this game was also made using the terribly crappy art of a 7th grader, odd controls, and a 
hidden impossible level which I have not even beaten myself (but I know is beatable). This is a simple lunar lander game, with 2 levels, as well as a hidden third level. You play 
as a rocket ship and must navigate to a landing strip. Warning: When you beat the first level, the second level begins automatically. Also, if I remember correctly, you only have 
1 life, and you have to restart if you die (which will most likely happen a lot).</p>
